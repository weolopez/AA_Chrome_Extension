# Chrome Web Store Privacy Practices Information for Auto Architect

This document contains the information required for the "Privacy practices" tab in the Chrome Web Store developer dashboard for the Auto Architect extension (ID: ieidaojmimdcidpnpndeofpbkgfimkjj).

---

## Single Purpose

**Single purpose description:**

To provide users with AI-powered software architecture suggestions and analysis based on their input, clipboard content, or the content of their active web page, helping them learn and apply architectural best practices.

---

## Permission Justification

**`identity` justification:**

This permission is used solely to authenticate the user via Google Sign-In, allowing the extension to personalize the experience and potentially associate saved data (like design history or preferences stored using the `storage` permission) with their account. User profile information is handled as described in our privacy policy.

**`activeTab` justification:**

This permission allows the extension to access the content of the user's currently active tab *only when the user explicitly invokes the extension* (e.g., by clicking the extension icon or a context menu item). This access is necessary to analyze the page's content (like code snippets, diagrams, or text) to provide relevant architectural suggestions or feedback. No data is accessed without direct user interaction.

**`scripting` justification:**

This permission is used in conjunction with `activeTab` to programmatically interact with the content of the active page *after user invocation*. It enables the extension to potentially extract specific user-selected information from the page or highlight relevant sections related to the architectural suggestions provided. It is essential for analyzing web content to fulfill the extension's core purpose.

**`storage` justification:**

This permission is used to store user-specific settings (like preferences) and potentially save drafts or history of architectural suggestions locally on the user's machine. This allows for a persistent and personalized experience across sessions, as outlined in our privacy policy. No sensitive data is stored.

**`notifications` justification:**

This permission enables the extension to display system notifications to alert the user about the completion of long-running analysis tasks or provide important updates related to the extension's operation, enhancing user experience for asynchronous operations.

**`contextMenus` justification:**

This permission allows the extension to add specific actions to the browser's right-click context menu. This provides users with a convenient way to invoke the extension's features directly on selected text or elements within a webpage (e.g., "Analyze selected code with Auto Architect").

**`clipboardWrite` justification:**

This permission allows the user to easily copy the architectural suggestions or code snippets generated by the extension directly to their clipboard via a button click within the extension's interface, improving usability. The extension only writes to the clipboard upon explicit user action.

**`clipboardRead` justification:**

This permission enables users to paste text (e.g., code, requirements) directly into the extension's input fields from their clipboard. This is a core mechanism for users to provide input for architectural analysis. The extension only reads the clipboard when the user explicitly uses a paste action within the extension's UI.

**`sidePanel` justification:**

This permission is used to display the extension's primary user interface within the browser's side panel. This allows users to interact with the extension's features alongside their web content without needing a separate pop-up window.

**Host permission justification (`https://cabalbot-apim.azure-api.net/*`):**

This permission is required to securely communicate with our backend API hosted at `cabalbot-apim.azure-api.net`. This API processes user requests (like text or page content analysis) using AI models to generate architectural suggestions. Data transmission is encrypted, and usage complies with our privacy policy. No user data is stored long-term on the server.

## Remote Code

**Are you using remote code?**

[X] Yes, I am using Remote code

**Justification:**

The extension communicates with the backend service specified in the host permissions (`https://cabalbot-apim.azure-api.net/*`) to leverage complex AI models for generating architectural suggestions. No executable code is downloaded or run; the extension only sends data for analysis and receives structured data (suggestions, analysis results) in return via secure API calls. This interaction is essential for the core functionality of providing AI-powered assistance.

## Data Usage

**What user data do you plan to collect from users now or in the future?**

*   [X] **Personally identifiable information** (Email address and Google profile via `identity` for sign-in)
*   [ ] Health information
*   [ ] Financial and payment information
*   [ ] Authentication information (Passwords/credentials are handled by Google Sign-In, not directly by the extension)
*   [ ] Personal communications
*   [ ] Location
*   [ ] Web history (Only active tab content upon user action, not browsing history)
*   [X] **User activity** (Interactions with extension UI like context menus, side panel usage)
*   [X] **Website content** (Active tab content upon user action, clipboard content when used by the user)

**Certifications (You must check these in the dashboard):**

*   [ ] I do not sell or transfer user data to third parties, outside of the approved use cases
*   [ ] I do not use or transfer user data for purposes that are unrelated to my item's single purpose
*   [ ] I do not use or transfer user data to determine creditworthiness or for lending purposes
