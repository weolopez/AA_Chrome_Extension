Privacy Policy for Auto Architect Chrome Extension

Effective Date: [Insert Date]

Auto Architect ("we", "our", or "us") values your privacy. This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and how we protect your information.

1. Information We Collect:
- Email address and Google profile (for sign-in)
- Clipboard content (only when explicitly used)
- Tab and browsing activity (only for the active tab or user-selected content)
- Local storage data (preferences, drafts)
- API Key provided by the user (used for accessing the Gemini API via our proxy server)
- Interaction with context menus and side panels

2. How We Use Data:
- To generate and deliver AI-assisted architectural suggestions
- To personalize the user experience
- To store and recall design history
- To notify users of updates or completions
- To facilitate requests to the Gemini API: When making a request, your API key and prompt are securely sent to our proxy server, which then uses your API key to call the Gemini API on your behalf.

3. Data Sharing and Proxy Server Usage:
- We do not sell or share your data with third parties.
- Your API key and prompt are transmitted to our proxy server (e.g., POST /api/chat-user-key). The proxy server uses your API key solely for the immediate request to the Gemini API and does not retain or log your API key.
- Data transmitted to our proxy server is secured via HTTPS and is only used to obtain a prompt response from the Gemini API.

4. User Controls:
- Users can revoke permissions at any time via Chrome's extension settings.
- Users can delete stored data, including the API key, through the extensionâ€™s options page.

5. Security:
- All communications, including those to our proxy server and the Gemini API, are encrypted via HTTPS.
- The extension securely saves your API key using chrome.storage.sync or chrome.storage.local.
- We have implemented measures to ensure that your API key is used only for the immediate requests and is not stored beyond what is necessary for processing your prompt.

6. Trust and Responsibility:
- By providing your API key, you acknowledge that you trust our proxy server to use your key solely for calling the Gemini API.
- We are committed to transparency and ensuring that your API key is not misused or retained.
- Please review the proxy server's implementation notes in our documentation if you have further concerns.
